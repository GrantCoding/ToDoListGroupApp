# ToDoListGroupApp
I made a rough draft of what the entire project could look like including a Task, toDo, and driver file. It is very simple for now but I wanted to get an idea of how we can start putting the GUI part together. 
Yet to complete:
  -write ArrayList to file
  -load ArrayList from file
  -clean up GUI?
